Great! Let's go through **Encryption Analysis and Decryption Testing** using **VeraCrypt** and **GPG** on **Kali Linux** — both are powerful tools used in cybersecurity, digital forensics, and privacy.

## 🔐 PART 1: **VeraCrypt Encryption & Decryption on Kali**

### ✅ Step 1: Install VeraCrypt (if not already installed)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install veracrypt -y
```

---

### ✅ Step 2: Create an Encrypted Volume

```bash
veracrypt --text
```

Then:

```bash
veracrypt --text --create myvolume.hc
```

You’ll be guided through:

* Volume type: `[1] Normal`
* File location: `myvolume.hc`
* Encryption Algorithm: `[1] AES` (default)
* Hash: `[1] SHA-512` (default)
* Size: e.g., `100M`
* Password: (set a strong one)
* Filesystem: `ext3`, `FAT`, etc.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Mount the Encrypted Volume

```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/secure
veracrypt myvolume.hc /mnt/secure
```

You’ll be prompted for the password.

---

### ✅ Step 4: Use it like a normal drive

```bash
cd /mnt/secure
echo "Confidential Data" > secret.txt
```

---

### ✅ Step 5: Dismount

```bash
veracrypt -d
```

---

## 🔍 Analysis Tips:

* Check file size: `ls -lh myvolume.hc`
* Try to brute-force (for analysis only) with tools like `veracrypt-volume-analysis` (Kali has plugins)
* Observe structure with `hexdump`, `binwalk`, or `strings` on the container file

---

## 🔐 PART 2: **GPG (GNU Privacy Guard)** Encryption & Decryption

### ✅ Step 1: Generate a GPG Key

```bash
gpg --full-generate-key
```

* Choose: RSA + RSA
* Key size: 2048 or 4096
* Validity: 0 = never expires
* Name, email, and passphrase: Enter accordingly

---

### ✅ Step 2: Encrypt a File

Create a file:

```bash
echo "Top Secret Message" > message.txt
```

Encrypt it:

```bash
gpg -e -r "Your Name" message.txt
```

This creates: `message.txt.gpg`

---

### ✅ Step 3: Decrypt the File

```bash
gpg -d message.txt.gpg > decrypted.txt
```

Verify:

```bash
cat decrypted.txt
```

---

## 🔍 GPG Analysis Tips:

* Use `gpg --list-keys` to inspect stored keys
* Use `gpg --export -a` to backup public keys
* Check encryption headers with `hexdump`, `file`, or `binwalk`

## 📋 Summary

| Tool      | Task                    | Command Example                       |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| VeraCrypt | Create encrypted volume | `veracrypt --text --create volume.hc` |
| VeraCrypt | Mount volume            | `veracrypt volume.hc /mnt/secure`     |
| GPG       | Generate key            | `gpg --full-generate-key`             |
| GPG       | Encrypt file            | `gpg -e -r "Name" file.txt`           |
| GPG       | Decrypt file            | `gpg -d file.txt.gpg > output.txt`    |
