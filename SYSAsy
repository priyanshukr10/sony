To use **CrypTool** for both **symmetric** and **asymmetric encryption/decryption**, follow these steps. CrypTool is an open-source educational tool for cryptographic methods and algorithms.

> ✳️ If you haven’t already, download CrypTool from [https://www.cryptool.org](https://www.cryptool.org) (choose either CrypTool 1 or CrypTool 2; instructions below are for **CrypTool 1** for simplicity).

## 🔐 **Symmetric Key Encryption/Decryption in CrypTool 1**

### ✅ Example: Encrypt and Decrypt with AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)

#### 🔹 Encryption Steps:

1. Open CrypTool 1.
2. Type a message in the main text area.
3. Go to `Crypt` > `Symmetric (classic)` > `AES`.
4. Choose **Encrypt**.
5. Enter a **password/key** (e.g., `mypassword123`) and choose a **key size** (e.g., 128-bit).
6. Click OK – your text will be encrypted (shown in hex or binary).

#### 🔹 Decryption Steps:

1. Copy or keep the encrypted message.
2. Paste it into a new CrypTool window.
3. Go to `Crypt` > `Symmetric (classic)` > `AES`.
4. Choose **Decrypt**.
5. Enter the **same key/password** used during encryption.
6. Click OK – you will see the original message.

## 🔐 **Asymmetric Key Encryption/Decryption in CrypTool 1**

### ✅ Example: Using RSA

#### 🔹 Step 1: Generate RSA Key Pair

1. Go to `Keys` > `Generate/Import Key Pair`.
2. Choose `RSA` and specify key size (e.g., 1024 or 2048 bits).
3. Save both public and private keys for later use.

#### 🔹 Step 2: Encrypt with Public Key

1. Type a message in the main text window.
2. Go to `Crypt` > `Asymmetric` > `RSA`.
3. Choose `Encrypt`.
4. Load the **public key** file you saved earlier.
5. The message is encrypted and displayed.

#### 🔹 Step 3: Decrypt with Private Key

1. Paste the encrypted message into a new CrypTool window.
2. Go to `Crypt` > `Asymmetric` > `RSA`.
3. Choose `Decrypt`.
4. Load the corresponding **private key**.
5. The decrypted message (original text) will appear.

## ✅ Tips

* CrypTool 1 provides visual feedback and statistics – explore `Analysis` to see how secure your encrypted messages are.
* If you're using **CrypTool 2**, the process is more visual (drag-and-drop workflow using blocks for encryption/decryption).
