Here's a **step-by-step guide for conducting demo and lab sessions** using the **CyberCheck Suite on Kali Linux**, tailored for training, education, or live demonstrations in cyber forensics.

---

## 🛠️ What is **CyberCheck Suite**?

**CyberCheck Suite** is a GUI-based digital forensic tool developed by CDAC for **law enforcement and academic forensics**. It helps with:

* Disk imaging
* File carving
* Keyword search
* Hash analysis
* Windows artifact recovery (Registry, Event Logs)
* Email and chat analysis

> ⚠️ **CyberCheck Suite is not included by default in Kali Linux**. You must request it from [CDAC Pune](https://www.cdac.in/), as it is typically provided to agencies or certified training institutes.

---

## 📦 **Installing CyberCheck Suite on Kali Linux**

> ✅ Assuming you’ve received the **installer (`.tar.gz` or `.run`) and license** from CDAC.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk libqt5widgets5 libsqlite3-0
```

> CyberCheck Suite uses Java and Qt-based GUI components.

---

### Step 2: Extract and Install

```bash
tar -xzvf CyberCheckSuite.tar.gz
cd CyberCheckSuite
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

OR, if it's a `.run` file:

```bash
chmod +x CyberCheckSuite.run
sudo ./CyberCheckSuite.run
```

---

### Step 3: Launch the Tool

Once installed:

```bash
cd /opt/CyberCheckSuite
./CyberCheckSuite.sh
```

You will see a GUI interface with modules like:

* **Disk Imaging**
* **File Carver**
* **Hash Compare**
* **Email Parser**
* **Registry Analyzer**

# 🔍 DEMO & LAB SESSION PLAN

## 💡 **Session 1: Introduction to CyberCheck Suite Interface**

### Objectives:

* Understand GUI layout
* Explore modules and features

**Tasks:**

* Launch tool
* Navigate modules
* Show case examples from demo images

---

## 💡 **Session 2: Disk Imaging and Hashing**

### Tools: Disk Image Module, MD5/SHA1

**Steps:**

1. Attach a USB drive or use a `.dd` image
2. Use `Disk Imaging` to create an image (RAW format)
3. Generate and save hash values
4. Compare hashes with the original

✅ Learning: Chain of custody, integrity

---

## 💡 **Session 3: File Carving and Deleted File Recovery**

### Tools: File Carver

**Steps:**

1. Load a `.dd` image
2. Run **File Carver**
3. Select file types (JPG, DOCX, EXE, etc.)
4. Extract and export carved files

✅ Learning: Recover deleted evidence from disk

---

## 💡 **Session 4: Registry and Log File Analysis**

### Tools: Registry Viewer, Log Viewer

**Steps:**

1. Load a forensic image of a Windows system
2. View `NTUSER.DAT`, `SYSTEM`, `SOFTWARE`
3. Extract USB device history, run commands, user accounts

✅ Learning: Timeline and user activity reconstruction

---

## 💡 **Session 5: Keyword Search and Hash Analysis**

### Tools: Keyword Search, Known File Hash DB

**Steps:**

1. Define keywords (e.g., `password`, `credit card`)
2. Run string search across disk
3. Use hash set (NSRL or custom) to identify known/unknown files

✅ Learning: Investigative search, whitelist filtering

---

## 💡 **Session 6: Email and Chat Analysis**

### Tools: PST/MBOX Parser

**Steps:**

1. Load a `.pst`, `.mbox`, or `.eml` file
2. Extract sender, recipient, subject, body
3. Export to PDF or CSV

✅ Learning: Email forensics and evidence extraction

---

# 🧪 Sample LAB EXERCISE Template

### **Lab Title**: Email and File Carving from Infected Disk Image

1. Load provided `.dd` image in CyberCheck Suite.
2. Use File Carver to extract deleted `.docx` and `.jpg` files.
3. Use Email Parser to read `.mbox` or `.pst` files.
4. Search for keyword: `bank`, `password`.
5. Generate a final evidence report from CyberCheck Suite.

---

# 📁 Where to Get Sample Images

Use freely available forensic images from:

* [https://digitalcorpora.org](https://digitalcorpora.org/)
* [https://www.vx-underground.org](https://www.vx-underground.org/)
* Training DVDs from CDAC or NASSCOM
