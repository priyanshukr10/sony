# 🔐 PART 1: Understanding the Basics

### ✅ Encoding vs Encryption vs Hashing:

| Technique  | Purpose              | Reversible | Key Used |
| ---------- | -------------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Encoding   | Data transformation  | ✅ Yes      | ❌ No     |
| Encryption | Confidentiality      | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes    |
| Hashing    | Data integrity check | ❌ No       | ❌ No     |

---

# 💻 PART 2: DEMO – Encoding Techniques

## ✅ 1. Base64 Encoding/Decoding

```bash
echo "CyberForensics" | base64
# Output: Q3liZXJGb3JlbnNpY3M=

echo "Q3liZXJGb3JlbnNpY3M=" | base64 -d
```

## ✅ 2. Hex Encoding with `xxd`

```bash
echo "Forensics" | xxd
echo "466f72656e73696373" | xxd -r -p
```

---

# 🔐 PART 3: DEMO – Symmetric Encryption with OpenSSL

## ✅ 1. Encrypt a file using AES-256

```bash
echo "Secret message for lab" > message.txt
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in message.txt -out message.enc
```

## ✅ 2. Decrypt it:

```bash
openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in message.enc -out decrypted.txt
cat decrypted.txt
```

> 🔐 You'll be prompted for a password both times.

---

## ✅ 3. Use other symmetric algorithms:

```bash
openssl enc -list | grep aes
```

Try with: `-aes-128-cbc`, `-aes-256-ecb`, `-des`, `-rc4`, etc.

---

# 🔐 PART 4: DEMO – Asymmetric Encryption with GPG

## ✅ 1. Generate GPG Key Pair

```bash
gpg --full-generate-key
```

Choose:

* RSA and RSA
* 2048-bit key
* Name and email (use fake data for demo)

## ✅ 2. Encrypt a file

```bash
gpg -e -r "Your Name" message.txt
```

This creates `message.txt.gpg`.

## ✅ 3. Decrypt it

```bash
gpg -d message.txt.gpg > decrypted.txt
```

---

# 🔍 PART 5: Hashing Demo

## ✅ 1. Hash a File

```bash
sha256sum message.txt
md5sum message.txt
```

## ✅ 2. Verify Hash Integrity

Make a change to the file and re-run the hash to show mismatch.

# 🧪 PART 6: LAB EXERCISE IDEAS

### 🔸 **Lab 1: Encoding Challenge**

* Encode a message in Base64 and hex
* Give students the encoded string and ask them to decode it

### 🔸 **Lab 2: Symmetric Encryption**

* Encrypt a file using AES
* Share the ciphertext with a partner for decryption

### 🔸 **Lab 3: Asymmetric GPG Pair Exchange**

* Generate key pairs
* Share public keys
* Encrypt a message for your lab partner
* Decrypt using private key

### 🔸 **Lab 4: Hash Cracking Exercise** (for forensic relevance)

Use `john` or `hashcat` to simulate hash cracking (with weak passwords)

```bash
echo -n "password123" | sha256sum
```

Then try to brute-force it using `john`.

---

# 🧩 Optional: Use CrypTool via Wine

If you want GUI-based visualizations (especially for education):

1. Download CrypTool 1 or 2 from [https://www.cryptool.org](https://www.cryptool.org)
2. Install Wine:

```bash
sudo apt install wine
wine setup.exe
```

3. Use classic ciphers: Caesar, Vigenère, One-Time Pad, RSA, DES, AES

# ⚖️ Privacy & Legal Considerations

* 🔐 Never encrypt illegal content
* ✅ For lab use, always use mock data
* 🧾 Emphasize the importance of **strong key management** and **ethics**
