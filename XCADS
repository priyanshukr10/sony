Here's how to use **XCA** (X Certificate and Key Management) to **create a digital signature** certificate and then use it to **digitally sign Word and PDF documents**.

## 🔐 Step-by-Step Guide Using XCA

### ✅ Step 1: **Install XCA**

* Download XCA from [https://hohnstaedt.de/xca/](https://hohnstaedt.de/xca/)
* Install it on your system (Windows/Linux/macOS)

---

## 📁 Step 2: Create a Certificate for Digital Signature

1. **Open XCA**, go to `File > New Database` (create an `.xdb` database).

2. **Create a Private Key:**

   * Go to the **"Private Keys"** tab.
   * Click **"New Key"** → choose RSA 2048 or 4096 bits → name it.

3. **Create a Certificate:**

   * Go to the **"Certificates"** tab.
   * Click **"New Certificate"**.
   * In the wizard:

     * **Template**: Choose `CA:signing only` or leave default.
     * **Subject**: Fill in fields like `CN = Your Name`, `Email = your@email.com`.
     * **Key Usage**: Ensure `Digital Signature` is selected.
     * **Extensions**: Add Subject Alternative Names if needed.
   * Select the key created earlier.
   * Set validity (e.g., 1 year).
   * Sign the certificate **with itself** (self-signed).
   * Click **"Generate"**.

4. **Export the Certificate:**

   * Go to the Certificates tab.
   * Right-click your certificate:

     * Export **Certificate** as `.crt` or `.cer`.
     * Export **Private Key** as `.pem` or `.pfx` (with a password if required).
   * Export as **PKCS#12 (.p12)** if you want to import it into Windows, Word, or Adobe.

## 📝 Step 3: **Digitally Sign a Word Document**

1. **Install the Certificate in Windows:**

   * Double-click the `.p12` or `.pfx` file.
   * Import into the **Personal Store** of Windows Certificate Manager.

2. **Open your Word Document (Office 2016 or later):**

   * Go to `File` > `Info`.
   * Click **"Protect Document"** > **Add a Digital Signature**.
   * Choose your installed certificate.
   * Add a purpose for signing, click OK.

✅ Word will show a signature bar indicating the document is signed.

## 📄 Step 4: **Digitally Sign a PDF Document**

### Option 1: **Using Adobe Acrobat Pro**

1. Import your certificate into Windows (as above).
2. Open the PDF in **Adobe Acrobat Pro**.
3. Go to `Tools` > `Certificates` > **Digitally Sign**.
4. Draw the signature area on the document.
5. Choose your XCA-generated certificate from the list.
6. Enter your password if needed (for the private key).
7. Save the signed PDF.

✅ The signature will appear visibly, and Adobe will validate it (may show a warning if self-signed).
