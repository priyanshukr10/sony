Great — you're diving into **hex-level file and memory analysis**, often used in **forensics**, **malware analysis**, and **reverse engineering**.

On **Kali Linux**, while **HxD** is a Windows hex editor, **you can use several Linux alternatives** to achieve the same functionality — including **bless**, **hexedit**, **xxd**, and **GHex**.

## 🔧 TOOLS FOR HEX / BYTE-LEVEL ANALYSIS ON KALI

| Tool      | Type          | Usage                              |
| --------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `xxd`     | CLI           | Dump hex from file                 |
| `hexedit` | CLI (ncurses) | View/edit binary files in terminal |
| `bless`   | GUI           | Advanced graphical hex editor      |
| `GHex`    | GUI           | GNOME hex editor, user-friendly    |
| `GDB`     | CLI           | Memory-level debugging             |

---

## ✅ INSTALLING TOOLS

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install hexedit bless ghex -y
```

---

## 🧪 HEX ANALYSIS TASK EXAMPLES

### 🟢 1. **View File in Hex (with `xxd`)**

```bash
xxd -g 1 sample_file.bin | less
```

* `-g 1`: groups bytes by 1 (you can use 2, 4, etc.)
* Shows offset, hex, and ASCII side-by-side

---

### 🟢 2. **Edit File in Hex (with `hexedit`)**

```bash
hexedit sample_file.bin
```

* Use arrow keys to move
* Edit bytes directly
* Press `Ctrl+X` to exit, save if prompted

---

### 🟢 3. **Search/Replace Bytes (with `bless` or `GHex`)**

```bash
bless sample_file.bin
```

or

```bash
ghex sample_file.bin
```

You can:

* Navigate to byte offset
* Modify bytes directly
* View ASCII alongside

---

### 🟢 4. **Extract Hidden Content / Stego Clues**

Sometimes stego or malware hides strings:

```bash
strings -n 4 sample_file.bin
```

Use this with `xxd` to correlate suspicious areas.

---

## 🧠 MEMORY DUMP ANALYSIS (BYTE LEVEL)

If you have a `.raw` memory dump (e.g., from FTK Imager or Volatility target):

```bash
xxd memdump.raw | less
```

* Look for suspicious headers (e.g., `MZ` for executables, JPEG headers, etc.)
* You can carve files manually by hex signature

---

## 📂 COMMON FILE SIGNATURES TO LOOK FOR

| File Type | Hex Header    | ASCII         |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| EXE       | `4D 5A`       | `MZ`          |
| PNG       | `89 50 4E 47` | `.PNG`        |
| JPG       | `FF D8 FF`    | Start of JPEG |
| PDF       | `25 50 44 46` | `%PDF`        |
| ZIP       | `50 4B 03 04` | `PK`          |

You can find hidden files by locating these headers and extracting that section of the binary.

---

## 🧬 EXTRACTING FILES FROM HEX

Suppose you find a PDF starting at offset `0x4F00`:

```bash
dd if=sample_file.bin of=extracted.pdf bs=1 skip=20224
```

> `20224` = `0x4F00` in decimal

## 🧾 SUMMARY COMMANDS

| Task                    | Command                                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| View hex dump           | `xxd file.bin`                          |
| Interactive hex editing | `hexedit file.bin`                      |
| GUI hex editing         | `bless file.bin` or `ghex file.bin`     |
| Dump strings            | `strings file.bin`                      |
| Find file signatures    | `xxd`, `grep`, `hexdump`, or `binwalk`  |
| Carve from offset       | `dd if=file.bin of=newfile skip=N bs=1` |

## ✅ Want a Live Lab?

I can provide:

* A challenge file (`.bin`) containing a hidden PDF or EXE
* Tasks: “Find hidden file”, “Change metadata”, “Patch binary”
* Scoring sheet (for classroom/assignments)

Would you like me to prepare that?
